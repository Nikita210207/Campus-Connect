Why This Project Matters
In most colleges, important information is scattered across multiple platforms such as emails, WhatsApp groups, and physical notice boards. This makes it difficult for students to stay organized and often leads to missed or outdated information. CampusConnect addresses this problem by providing a single, centralized hub where students can stay updated with official announcements, prepare in advance for exams, and quickly access useful study materials. It is not just a project, but a practical tool designed for real student needs.
